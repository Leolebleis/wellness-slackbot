# wellness-slackbot
A wellness slackbot using python libraries.

After installing the requirements.txt, set up your app on slack and use public urls (with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs) for example) to connect to the slack events api.

This heavily follows [this workshop](https://github.com/slackapi/build-this-bot-workshop/).
